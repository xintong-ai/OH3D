// 
//! Initially part of the ACL Visualization Library moved into 
//! scout to clean things up some and remove external dependencies.
//! Updated to the new 20-mule-team scout framework. Effectively gutted this
//! part of it to alter the behavior somewhat.
//! This class must service a number of different rotations so the internal
//! state it maintained became a problem. Rather than clear the quaternions
//! each time and start fresh, each update operations returns Rotations for
//! us to do with as we will. In fact, we will hand them off to the Transform
//! class which will composite them for the rotation part thereof.
//! 
//! Based on SGI's trackball.h---see copyright at end of this file.

  //! Given the x,y screen position and the radius of the trackball,
  //! this returns the missing z coordinate that places the point on the sphere
  //! or hyperbolic sheet if outside the sphere
