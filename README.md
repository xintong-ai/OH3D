## Synopsis

This project was a deformation-based scientific visualization research by PhD students Xin Tong and Cheng Li from The Ohio State University with Prof. Han-Wei Shen. This project is a library containing a lot of toolkits, which can be used for other scientific visualization researches and developments.


## Code Example

This project can create an executable program for each subfolder in the 'programs' folder. Other folders are used to build libraries used by these executable programs. The program TutorialVis is a short program better for starters. The executable programs follow the Model–View–Controller design. /programs/TutorialVis/windows.cpp contains rich comments to explain this recommanded way to build programs.

Besides TutorialVis in the 'programs' folder, ParticleVis is used in citations [1] and [2]; TensorVis is used in citation [1]; VolumeVis is used in citation [2]. (please note low-level settings might have been changed since the papers are published. Refer to previous commits of the project for exact reproduction.) Other programs are test programs which are not well maintained and are not recommanded


## Installation

Use CMake to build the project.

The required libraries for this project include QT, NVidia GPU (CUDA), and glm (http://glm.g-truc.net/). It has been tested on a Windows environment with QT 5.5 and CUDA 7.5, using Microsoft Visual Studio 2013 and 64-bit built.

Optional settings include:

BUILD_TUTORIAL: build /programs/TutorialVis.

BUILD_TEST: build some programs in 'programs' folder which are still under test.

USE_TEEM: the library Teem (http://teem.sourceforge.net/index.html) is required by the program TensorVis. Need to install related libraries.

USE_LEAP: use the Leap Motion controller. Need to install related libraries from (https://www.leapmotion.com/).

USE_OSVR: use the OSVR headset. Need to install related libraries from (http://www.osvr.org/).

USE_TOUCHSCREEN: use touchscreen. Note that we used QT touch screen functions, so the touch pad need to be supported by QT, such as touchable PC laptops, or android tablets.

USE_CONTROLLER: use HTC VIVE controller (not tested yet).
